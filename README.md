# my_wallet
this is a simple app to give the user the ability to manage his/her finance (money) and track the amount she/he got or spent

written in python3 with SQLAlchemy framework and PyQt5 for the gui

~small note: I'm not good with the UI (front end)~

### important note:
#### to run the app, python3 must be installed on your machine
