# my_wallet
this is a simple app to give the user the ability to manage his/her finance (money) and track the amount she/he got or spent

written in python3 with SQLAlchemy framework and PyQt5 for the gui

~small note: I'm not good with the UI (front end)~

### important note:
#### to run the app, python3 must be installed on your machine
<br>

### installation:
1. download (either download zip file, or clone the repo)
2. * if you're using windows, open cmd (command prompt) in your current directory<br>
(either write cmd in the location bar, or hold SHIFT and right click then open cmd)
after that execute ```run.bat``` and it will download the required libraries for the app

    * if you're using linux or mac os, open terminal in your current directory
        * on linux just right click then open in terminal
        * on mac right click on the folder (my_wallet) then open terminal window in folder<br>
    * after that execute ```bash run.sh``` and it will download the required libraries for the app
  
3. after that every time you want to run the app
    * on widows open cmd or powershell on my_wallet directory then execute ```.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\src\main.py``` (or python3.exe if it's exists in the Scripts folder)
