# my_wallet
this is a simple app to give the user the ability to manage his/her finance (money) and track the amount she/he got or spent

written in python3 with SQLAlchemy framework and PyQt5 for the gui

~small note: I'm not good with the UI (front end)~

### important note:
#### to run the app, python3 must be installed on your machine
<br>

### installation:
1. download (either download zip file, or clone the repo).
2. ```pip``` or ```pip3 install -r requirments.txt``` in terminal or cmd to install required packages.
3. * run ```python3 src/main.py``` in terminal (linux and osx) to run the app.
   * on windows just double click ```main.py``` which is inside `src` folder.
